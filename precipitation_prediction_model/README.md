Introduction
Provide a brief overview of the project, its goals, and the significance of predicting precipitation using AI models.

Models
Hourly Model
Explain the purpose and methodology of the Hourly Model. Include details about the ROC dataset, preprocessing steps, and the machine learning algorithms utilized.

Daily Model
Describe the Daily Model, focusing on the 3538140 dataset, preprocessing techniques such as imputation and Min-Max scaling, and the machine learning algorithms employed.

Preprocessing
Discuss the preprocessing steps applied to both datasets, highlighting any variations between the Hourly and Daily models.

Data Splitting and Model Validation
Explain the data splitting strategy (e.g., 70/30 split) and the techniques employed for validating the models. Mention any specific considerations for each model.

API Integration
Detail the development of the API that integrates both models. Discuss the API endpoints, their purposes, and how users can leverage the API for weather predictions.

Usage
Provide instructions on how users can use the code, run the models, and interact with the API.

Contributing
Outline guidelines for contributors, including information on how to report issues, propose enhancements, and submit pull requests.
