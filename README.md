<h2>Introduction</h2>
Provide a brief overview of the project, its goals, and the significance of predicting precipitation using AI models.

<h2>Models</h2>
<h3>Hourly Model</h3>
Explain the purpose and methodology of the Hourly Model. Include details about the ROC dataset, preprocessing steps, and the machine learning algorithms utilized.

<h3>Daily Model</h3>
Describe the Daily Model, focusing on the 3538140 dataset, preprocessing techniques such as imputation and Min-Max scaling, and the machine learning algorithms employed.

<h2>Preprocessing</h2>
Discuss the preprocessing steps applied to both datasets, highlighting any variations between the Hourly and Daily models.

<h2>Data Splitting and Model Validation</h2>
Explain the data splitting strategy (e.g., 70/30 split) and the techniques employed for validating the models. Mention any specific considerations for each model.

<h2>API Integration</h2>
Detail the development of the API that integrates both models. Discuss the API endpoints, their purposes, and how users can leverage the API for weather predictions.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Provide instructions on how users can use the code, run the models, and interact with the API.

<h2>Contributing</h2>
Outline guidelines for contributors, including information on how to report issues, propose enhancements, and submit pull requests.
